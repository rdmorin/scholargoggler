Description: This is the code for the Shiny app known as Scholar Goggler. The output of this site is a word cloud that summarizes the academic publications from a Google Scholar profile. It works by obtaining a Google Scholar ID from the user and, via the Google Scholar API, gets the titles from the publications from that author. The words are tabulated by frequency and represented as a word cloud.
